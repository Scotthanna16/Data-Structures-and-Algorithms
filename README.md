# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Repository for my Data Structures class work and Algorithms class work.
All of this was written pretty early on in my coding career...so don't judge to hard. It's nothing super interesting, just some basic data structures (linked-list, stack, queue, BST etc) and algorithms (sorting, hashing, etc).
