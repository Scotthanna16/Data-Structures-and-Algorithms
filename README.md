# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Repository for my Data Structures class work and Algorithms class work.
All of this was written pretty early on in my coding career...so don't judge to hard. 
Also, if you are an employer there are a few repositories which are not open to the public at request of my professors, 
I can grant access if requested.
